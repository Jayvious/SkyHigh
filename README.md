## Project 1 -- Experience Cloud Site for Sky High School Org

### Overview

The Sky High Salesforce org was created to replicate the operations of a high school. To do that we created a ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram), which included objects related to school and the school environment (e.g Student, Teacher, Student Counselor, Classes, etc). From the ERD, we created the org with proper Object-Level, Field-Level, and Record-Level security to ensure that our org was used in the correct way. To further ehnace the org, we used out-of-the-box Process Automation tools (e.g Process Builder, Flow Builder, Approval Process) to streamline operatations. Using Apex, we continued to make our org more dynamic through the use of Apex Triggers and tested those triggers intesively. Our aim for this project was to create an administrative portal for staff members of the fictional Sky High School highschool, which could be used to view staff and student schedules, add new students, and track student graduation progress.
