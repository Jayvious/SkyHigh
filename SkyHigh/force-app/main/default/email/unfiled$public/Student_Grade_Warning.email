Hi (Mr/Mrs) {!Student__c.Parent_Last_Name__c},

I wanted to inform you that your student, {!Student__c.Name}, has not met the standards required in our school and their grades show that. I implore you to push your student to always do the best work they can so that they can catch up with their peers. Have a wonderful day! 

Sincerely, 
Sky High Faculty
