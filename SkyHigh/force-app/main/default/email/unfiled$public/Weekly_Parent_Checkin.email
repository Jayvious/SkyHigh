Hi (Mr/Mrs) {!Student__c.Parent_Last_Name__c}, 
For the week, our Students have been working in their classes and clubs to become smarter than a 5th grader. If they don't then they will be tested in other ways, such as hand to hand combat and Mario Kart Tournaments. This week there have been no major injuries in our classes. For the most part, we have a had a relatively peaceful week and hope for it continue into next week.
Sincerely,
Sky High Faculty
